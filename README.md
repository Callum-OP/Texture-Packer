# How to run
You can use Texture Packer directly in your browser:

- [Try on GitHub Pages](https://callum-op.github.io/Texture-Packer/)
- [Try on Itch.io](https://callum-op.itch.io/texture-packer)

Simply upload your image files, and the tool will automatically generate a spritesheet.  
Once complete, you can download both the spritesheet image and a JSON data file containing texture coordinates.

# About the app
I made this to easily create spritesheets when needed.
The JSON data output is similar to other free Texture Packer websites.

# Example Output
<img width="1908" height="890" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9663436-153c-4196-9035-3c47ad49ac9d" />
