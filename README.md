Just open the site on the index page (https://callum-op.github.io/Texture-Packer/) and enter your desired files, it will automatically create a spritesheet, 
then click the link to download the image of JSON data file.

# About the app
I made this to easily create spritesheets when needed.
The JSON data output is similar to other free Texture Packer websites.
